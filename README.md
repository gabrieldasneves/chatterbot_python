# chatterbot_python
Project that aims to develop a chatter bot with **python**.

## Motivation
Python's rise among developers around the world has been documented by several well-known programming-language indexes. Due to it,this little project aims to pratice Python while implementing a chatterbot.

## Theory

A chatbot is a computer program that mimics human conversation. Whether it’s text- or voice-based, a chatbot can automate communication with customers on behalf of your business.

These programs do complex tasks and work more like virtual assistants. They use ML and NLP to understand context, personalize communication, and learn as they go. They can also predict the types of issues customers might have and offer proactive solutions.
 
## Interface

The interface was developed im python and you can find it's code in the **gui_bot.py** file.
It looks like:

## P.S.:
This code is kin of simple, just install the dependencies I imported and run from terminal with **python project.py**

## The chatter Bot

 The chatterbot code can be found in the **project.py** file.
