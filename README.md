# chatterbot_python
Project that aims to develop a chatter bot with **python**.

## Motivation
Python's rise among developers around the world has been documented by several well-known programming-language indexes. Due to it,this little project aims to pratice Python while implementing a chatterbot.

## Theory

A chatbot is a computer program that mimics human conversation. Whether it’s text- or voice-based, a chatbot can automate communication with customers on behalf of your business.

These programs do complex tasks and work more like virtual assistants. They use ML and NLP to understand context, personalize communication, and learn as they go. They can also predict the types of issues customers might have and offer proactive solutions.
 
## Interface

The interface was developed im python and you can find it's code in the **gui_bot.py** file.
It looks like:



## Tech/framework used
Ex. -

<b>Built with</b>
- [Electron](https://electron.atom.io)

## Features
What makes your project stand out?

## Code Example
Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Installation
Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests
Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
If people like your project they’ll want to learn how they can use it. To do so include step by step guide to use your project.

## Contribute

Let people know how they can contribute into your project. A [contributing guideline](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-electron/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) will be a big plus.
